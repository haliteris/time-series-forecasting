# Task

The objective of the task is to see how you approach and build a model for reconstructing a time series signal based on other sensors in a sensory system. Furthermore, your task is to reconstruct the CO and Ethylene sensor based on 16 other chemical sensors. All sensors have a sampling frequency of 100Hz. Moreover, you have to predict CO and Ethylene at t0 given the history of other sensors until t0.
